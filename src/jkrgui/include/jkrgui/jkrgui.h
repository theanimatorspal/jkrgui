// Don't use C++ in headers, limit it to your source files
// Just use C Features here, so that it is easy to create APIs (you can create bindings for any language that way)
// Since C ABI is supported everywhere and is stable, your library/software will outlive you.
// You can declare functions (with C signatures), structs (With only C features), No Namespaces, use your_libname_struct, your_libname_func and constants.
