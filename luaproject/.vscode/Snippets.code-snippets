	// Place your jkrgui workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"RuleOfFive": {
		"prefix": "ruleOfFive",
		"body": [
			"struct CreateInfo {",
			"};",
			"",
			"$1() = default;",
			"~$1();",
			"$1(const $1& other)            = delete;",
			"$1& operator=(const $1& other) = delete;",
			"$1($1&& other)                 = default;",
			"$1& operator=($1&& other)      = default;",
			"operator vk::??() const { return ??; }",
			"",
			"void Init(CreateInfo inCreateInfo);",
			"void Destroy();"
